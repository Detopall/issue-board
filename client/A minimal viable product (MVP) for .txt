A minimal viable product (MVP) for an issue board using React could include the following features:

1. Issue List: Display a list of issues with their titles, descriptions, and statuses.

2. Add Issue: Provide a form or input field to add new issues to the board. Users can enter the title, description, and initial status of the issue.

3. Update Issue: Allow users to update the details of an existing issue, such as modifying the title, description, or status.

4. Drag and Drop: Implement drag and drop functionality to allow users to move issues between different status columns (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," , "Approval Needed", "Done").

EXTRA FEATURES

1. User Authentication: Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to access and collaborate on the issue board.

2. Issue Assignees: Add the ability to assign issues to specific users or team members. This can help track responsibility and ownership of each issue.

3. Due Dates: Include a due date field for issues to track deadlines and prioritize work accordingly.

4. Labels or Tags: Allow users to add labels or tags to categorize and filter issues based on different criteria, such as priority, type, or project.

5. Comments and Discussions: Enable users to add comments and have discussions on each issue, facilitating collaboration and communication.

6. Search and Filtering: Implement search functionality to quickly find specific issues based on keywords or filters. Users can search by title, description, assignee, or other attributes.

7. Notifications: Send notifications or alerts to users when there are updates or changes to issues they are involved in or following.

8. Data Persistence: Store the issue board data in a database or backend server to ensure data persistence and allow multiple users to access it concurrently.

Remember, these are just additional features that you could consider adding to enhance the functionality and user experience of your issue board. You can prioritize and implement them based on your specific requirements and project scope.
